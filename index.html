      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Kathryn studied at the wonderful and glorious University of Virginia, where she proved herself a brilliant consumer of frozen yogurt, made the dubious choice to major in Ancient Political Science (what up Aristotle?!), and was an valued member of her intermural intertube water polo team.  In 2010, Kathryn was awarded the "Best Female Vocalist" trophy at a famous New York karoake bar and was invited to tour with T-Pain.  Following this education, Kathryn went on to co-found the "Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good" which a Mr. Zoolander, which, sadly, was closed due to capacity issues.
